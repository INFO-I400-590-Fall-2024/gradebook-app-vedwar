## Prerequisites

Before we begin our journey into full-stack mobile development, we need to ensure our development environment is properly set up. These tools form the foundation of our development workflow:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed (These are essential tools for JavaScript development)
- The latest version of Expo CLI:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo
  ```
  Expo simplifies React Native development by providing a set of tools and services that make mobile development more accessible
- Basic familiarity with React Native and Expo
- A [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/) (free tier is fine)

## Firebase Project Setup

Before writing any code, we need to set up our project's backend infrastructure in Firebase. Think of this as creating your app's "home" in the cloud where all your data and services will live.

### 1. Create a Firebase Project
This is where we establish our app's presence in Firebase's ecosystem. Your Firebase project will be the central hub for all your backend services.

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a Project" (or "Add Project")
3. Enter a project name (e.g., "GradebookApp")
4. Choose whether to enable Google Analytics (recommended for tracking app usage)
5. Accept the terms and click "Create Project"

### 2. Register Your Web App
Now we need to tell Firebase about the web version of our app. This step generates the necessary credentials for your app to communicate with Firebase services.

1. Once your project is created, click the web icon (`</>`) 
2. Give your web application a nickname (e.g., "Gradebook App Web")
3. (Optional) Check "Also set up Firebase Hosting"
4. Click "Register app"
5. Save the Firebase configuration object shown - you'll need these values later

## Project Creation and Configuration

With our Firebase project ready, let's set up our local development environment. We'll create a new React Native project using Expo's latest template with built-in routing.

### Step 1: Create a New Expo Project
Here we're using Expo's tabs template, which gives us a pre-configured navigation structure:
```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest --template tabs@49 YourProjectName
cd YourProjectName
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
These packages provide the core functionality we need:
```bash
npm install --save firebase @expo/metro-runtime
```
- `firebase`: The core Firebase SDK for interacting with Firebase services
- `@expo/metro-runtime`: Enables proper web support for our Expo app

### Step 3: Install Firebase CLI and Initialize
The Firebase CLI allows us to interact with our Firebase project from the command line:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
```
When prompted:
- Choose whether to allow Firebase to collect CLI usage data
- Complete the Google authentication in your browser
- Wait for successful login confirmation

### Step 4: Initialize Firebase in Your Project
This step sets up Firebase Hosting and creates necessary configuration files:
```bash
firebase init hosting
```
During initialization, select:
- "Use an existing project"
- Your Firebase project from the list
- `web-build` as your public directory
- "Yes" to configure as a single-page app
- Whether to set up GitHub Actions (optional)

## Firebase Integration

Now comes the crucial part: connecting our local app to Firebase. We'll set this up in a way that's secure and maintainable.

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Environment variables keep our sensitive Firebase configuration separate from our code. This is crucial for security and makes it easier to manage different environments.

Create `app.config.js` in your project root:
```javascript
export default {
  expo: {
    name: "your-app-name",
    slug: "your-app-name",
    version: "1.0.0",
    extra: {
      firebaseApiKey: process.env.FIREBASE_API_KEY,
      firebaseAuthDomain: process.env.FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
      firebaseProjectId: process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
      firebaseStorageBucket: process.env.FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
      firebaseMessagingSenderId: process.env.FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
      firebaseAppId: process.env.FIREBASE_APP_ID,
    },
  }
};
```

Create `.env` in your project root:
```bash
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration
This file initializes our Firebase connection. Create `firebase.config.ts` in your project root:
```typescript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: Constants.expoConfig.extra.firebaseApiKey,
  authDomain: Constants.expoConfig.extra.firebaseAuthDomain,
  projectId: Constants.expoConfig.extra.firebaseProjectId,
  storageBucket: Constants.expoConfig.extra.firebaseStorageBucket,
  messagingSenderId: Constants.expoConfig.extra.firebaseMessagingSenderId,
  appId: Constants.expoConfig.extra.firebaseAppId,
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
```

## Using Firebase in Your App

Now let's create a component that demonstrates Firebase functionality. This example shows how to read from and write to Firestore, Firebase's NoSQL database.

Create a new component in `components/FirebaseExample.tsx`:
```typescript
import { View, Text } from './Themed';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { collection, addDoc, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { db } from '../firebase.config';

export default function FirebaseExample() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<any[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchItems = async () => {
      const querySnapshot = await getDocs(collection(db, 'items'));
      const itemsList = [];
      querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
        itemsList.push({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() });
      });
      setItems(itemsList);
    };

    fetchItems();
  }, []);

  const addItem = async (data: any) => {
    try {
      const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, 'items'), data);
      console.log('Document written with ID: ', docRef.id);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error adding document: ', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Your Firebase Data Here</Text>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Text key={item.id}>{item.name}</Text>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Deployment

Now that our app is built, let's make it accessible to users through Firebase Hosting. This process involves building our app for the web and uploading it to Firebase's servers.

### 1. Build Your Web Version
First, we need to create a production-ready version of our app:
```bash
npx expo export:web
```

### 2. Deploy to Firebase
This command uploads our built app to Firebase's hosting servers:
```bash
firebase deploy
```

You'll see output similar to:
```bash
=== Deploying to 'your-project-name'...
i  deploying hosting
i  hosting[your-project-name]: beginning deploy...
i  hosting[your-project-name]: found 1 files in web-build
✔  hosting[your-project-name]: file upload complete
✔  hosting[your-project-name]: version finalized
✔  hosting[your-project-name]: release complete
✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project-name/overview
Hosting URL: https://your-project-name.web.app
```

### 3. Access Your Deployed App
Your app is now live! You can:
- Visit the Hosting URL provided (e.g., `https://your-project-name.web.app`)
- Share this URL with others to access your app
- Monitor usage through the Firebase Console

## Important Notes & Troubleshooting

### Security Best Practices
Protecting your app and its data is crucial. Remember to:
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`
- Review [Firebase Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules)
- Keep Firebase configuration secure

### Common Issues
Here are solutions to problems you might encounter:

1. **Firebase Initialization Errors**
   - Check that your environment variables are correctly set
   - Ensure Firebase is only initialized once
   - Verify your Firebase config object

2. **Deployment Issues**
   - Make sure `web-build` directory exists before deploying
   - Check Firebase CLI is logged in correctly
   - Verify your project's hosting settings

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Restart your development server after changes
   - Double-check your `app.config.js` configuration
   - Ensure `.env` file is in the correct location

### Next Steps
Now that you have a working full-stack app, consider:
1. Implementing user authentication
2. Adding real-time data syncing
3. Setting up cloud functions
4. Configuring analytics and monitoring
